# CampsiteFinder 

The CampsiteFinder is a tool to help campers find available campsites in their state! The main page will allow you to see a list of campsites in the US, randomly generated so that you receive a new list of campsites with each refresh. 

The user is then able to select a state from the dropdown list to view campsites in National Parks in their state. The campsites shown should show the following information:

* Park Name
* Number of total sites
* Number of reservable sites
* The cost per night
* Information about how to book

When you select the name of the campsite, you will be shown the 5-day weather forecast for that area and more information about the campsite.

## User Story
